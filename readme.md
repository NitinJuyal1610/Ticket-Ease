# Ticketing System

The Ticketing System is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and resolve support tickets. It provides a centralized platform for users to report issues, request assistance, and receive timely support.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to the ticketing system. User authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the application.

- Ticket Management: Users can create new tickets by providing detailed descriptions of the issues they are facing. Support agents can view and manage tickets assigned to them. Ticket status can be tracked (e.g., open, in progress, resolved). Users and support agents can add comments and updates to tickets to track their progress.

- Role-based Access Control: The ticketing system implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user roles and permissions. Administrators have additional privileges to manage roles, assign permissions, and modify access control rules.

- Notifications: Email notifications are sent to users when their tickets are created, updated, or resolved. Users receive notifications about important updates and comments on their tickets.

- Knowledge Base Integration: The ticketing system integrates a knowledge base or FAQ section to provide self-help resources for users. Users can search and access relevant articles to find solutions to common issues before creating tickets.

- Implemented Considering MVCS (Model Views Controller Services) Architecture  & Typescript Classes 

## Tools Used

The Ticketing System is built using the following tools and technologies:

- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing improved code maintainability and reliability.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side, providing the foundation for building scalable applications.

- Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.

- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to interact with MongoDB databases and define data schemas.
