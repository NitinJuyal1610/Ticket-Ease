# Ticketing System

The Ticketing System is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and resolve support tickets. It provides a centralized platform for users to report issues, request assistance, and receive timely support.

## Features

- **System Architecture:** Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the ticketing system integrates with an email service provider for notifications.

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts and securely log in using authentication tokens or JWT.

- **Role-based Access Control:** Different roles (e.g., admin, support agent, user) are defined with access permissions.

- **Ticket Management:** Users can create detailed tickets, view and manage assigned tickets, and make updates.

- **Ticket Assignment:** Support agents can claim and assign tickets, allowing for reassignment if necessary.

- **Ticket Updates and Notifications:** Email notifications are sent to users for ticket creation and updates. API endpoints provide access to ticket history and comments.

- **Error Handling and Security:** Informative error messages, input validation, and secure authentication and authorization practices are implemented.

- **Testing and Documentation:** Unit and integration tests are written, and API endpoints are documented for clarity.

- **Deployment and Performance Optimization:** Backend components are deployed on hosting platforms, with monitoring and logging for performance optimization and issue troubleshooting.
 

## Tools Used

The Ticketing System is built using the following tools and technologies:

- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing improved code maintainability and reliability.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side, providing the foundation for building scalable applications.

- Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.

- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to interact with MongoDB databases and define data schemas.
